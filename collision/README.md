The concept of a quadtree is something I understood very gradually over a very long period and, without ChatGPT's generated examples, I imagine I would still be floundering and searching for answers to my endless questions. Why is it helpful for nodes to have set capacities? If you're going to split up the map, how does the program determine where to store each point? How do you keep track of, or call these endless, recursive child nodes? If you need to check each node anyway, how is it any better than checking each point to see if it is overlapping with a point of interest? All questions I can answer now.
